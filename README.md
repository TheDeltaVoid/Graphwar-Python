This is my take on the Graphwar Game.
Its not good or anything, lacks a lot of fetures and is unsafe and buggy. But I did enjoy the coding process and I leaned a lot.

If you want to run it by yourself download python from https://www.python.org (I used 3.13) and install these libaries:
- pyray (install as admin)
- raylib (install as admin)
- numpy

```
python -m pip install pyray
python -m pip install raylib
python -m pip install numpy
```

and then just start the main.py file: (assuming your in the same folder as the main.py file):

```
python main.py
```

TODO:
- implement networking in game
- hostnames other than localhost
- rework the settings menu
